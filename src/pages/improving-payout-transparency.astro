As support tickets around payouts spiked and utility partners raised concerns, we identified a trust gap caused by a lack of payout visibility.

                <div class="space-y-6">
                    <p>
                        The customer support team identified a 35% increase in payout-related tickets, even though no system errors or regressions had occurred. To investigate further, a cross-functional effort was launched: over 40 anonymized support tickets were reviewed, the backend admin panel logic was audited with engineering, and the live app UI was assessed from a user perspective.
                    </p>
                    <p>A clear pattern emerged: users couldn't see the status of their rewards, weren't sure if payouts had been sent, and often didn't know if any action was required on their part.</p>
                    <p>Meanwhile, the commercial team relayed concerns from utility partners, who were beginning to question the reliability of our incentive system due to ongoing user confusion. Together, these findings pointed to a key opportunity: a small UI improvement could deliver significant gains in user trust and partner confidence.</p>

                    <li>US-based users using common payout methods like PayPal and Venmo.</li>
                    <li>Newly enrolled users unfamiliar with our rewards system.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p class="mt-6">These were some of our most valuable users, and the ones most affected by the lack of transparency.</p>

                    <p>The backend contained 7+ payout states with subtle differences.
